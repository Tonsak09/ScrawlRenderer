# ScrawlRenderer

A godot application that converts dungeon scrawl json files into obj files. 

## How to use (WIP)

1) Convert your .ds file into a .zip and extract it
2) Rename your extracted file to be of type .json
3) Bring the file into maps folder
4) Select map in inspector (may require reload to view map)
5) Click the "Generate 3D" button

At this points there should be a preview of the mesh in the application and an .obj file will be generated in the Output folder
